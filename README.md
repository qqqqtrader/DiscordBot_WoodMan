You will need and auth.json file in the base directory.

Here is a sample:

{ 
    "Token"   : "TOKENFROMDISCORDBOT1wkklDbWcUv6kjeyKs3di3MNSM8",
    "Prefix" : "+", 
    "DebugChannel" : "440551618434301952"
}

Prefix is what character you want to start the commands.  +,! etc
DebugChannel is the channel for Message, use CopyID on a room and paste.
